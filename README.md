# musl_math
Plain C operational models of the math.h library. These files were extracted from the MUSL standard C library.

1. **op_models_full** supports all float, double and long double operations (except for complex numbers)

2. **op_models_log2** contains a minimal subset of files that support log2f() and log2() only
